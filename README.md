neuroscripts
============

Miscellaneous scripts I've written to help me work smarter.

They work for me, hopefully they'll work for you, but use at your own risk.

Actual relevance of each script to neuroimaging or neuroscience may be tenuous. 

Mask Overlap
------------
Calculates percent overlap between a group mask and individual subject masks. Useful for identifying registration outliers.

Cluster Smooth
--------------
Smoothing is *slow*. Use this script to speed things up by running fslmaths on an SGE cluster.

DX Count
--------
Count the number of subjects meeting each DSM diagnosis. To be used on data exported from the COINS system (http://ni.mrn.org).
