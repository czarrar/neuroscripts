neuroscripts
============

Miscellaneous scripts I use in my day to day work.

Mask Overlap
------------
Calculates percent overlap between a group mask and individual subject masks. Useful for identifying registration outliers.

Cluster Smooth
--------------
Smoothing is *slow*. Use this script to speed things up by running fslmaths on an SGE cluster.

DX Count
--------
Count the number of subjects meeting each DSM diagnosis. To be used on data exported from the COINS system (http://ni.mrn.org).
